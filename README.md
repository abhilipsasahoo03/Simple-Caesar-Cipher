# Simple-Caesar-Cipher

A simple Caesar Cipher webpage to encrypt and decrypt your text.

## Caesar Cipher

Also known as Shift Cipher involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by 'n' amount to either left or right. The 'n' may vary accordingly.

## About my code

In my project, I assumed the value of 'n' to be 4, and followed the method of encryption and decryption accordingly.

Here, the user has to input the text that is needed to be encrypted/decrypted and click the appropriate button.

A dialog box appears with the encrypted/decrypted text.

To run this HTML file locally:

1- Make sure all the pages are set up correctly for testing.

2- Use fully-qualified absolute paths for links.

3- Check the paths to the necessary .css and .js files.
